# OpenShift Serverless with Machine Learning

## Description 

Serverless computing allows developers to optimize their application usage by executing and billing on application resource consumption.  Traditionally, this execution model was offered by cloud providers in a non-portable manner.  Today, the serverless paradigm is offered on OpenShift - leveraging the innovation happening in the open source Knative project. This brings a key capability for developers to build portable cloud native applications in hybrid and multi-cloud environments.  

Serverless computing can power many use cases, including machine learning.  Machine learning algorithms build models that can make predictions based on identifying patterns in historical data.  Machine learning models can be loaded and executed in a serverless paradigm, bringing the benefits of the serverless execution model to developers seeking to enhance their cloud native applications with machine learning capabilities.

## Who should attend

The workshop is ideal for developers, operations professionals, architects and technical managers who are interested in getting hands on and exploring the benefits of using serverless technology. You should be familiar with containers and Kubernetes. No prior experience with Serverless, Functions as a Service, or Machine Learning is required.  Concepts as well as demonstrations of those ideas will be presented and explored.


## What you will learn

In this full day, hands-on workshop you'll learn the basics of running serverless applications on Red Hat OpenShift. You will also build a new user experience using serverless and machine learning.  You will get hands-on experience with:
- Serverless introduction and basics
- Machine learning inferencing in serverless code
- How serverless fosters innovation
- Event driven architecture
- Developing cloud native code and updating services
- Observability and metrics in serverless


## Introduction
Welcome to the workshop!

If you are on-site with us, the instructor will walk you through and kick off each lab.  Otherwise, if you're running this on your own, just go through the list of labs in order (as some build off of each other).

These labs have been tailored for OpenShift 4.x
