# OpenShift Serverless

## Description 

As modern applications move toward microservices based architectures the importance of a platform to back both development and operational work grows. Development teams struggle with building, debugging, and connecting services properly. And application operations teams face increasing challenges with hybrid deployments, scaling bottlenecks, recovering from failure, and gathering metrics. Red Hatâ€™s OpenShift Service Mesh lets you connect, secure, control, and observe your microservice based applications.


## Who should attend

The workshop is ideal for developers, operations professionals, architects and technical managers who are interested in getting hands on and exploring the benefits of using serverless technology. You should be familiar with containers and Kubernetes. No prior experience with Serverless or Functions as a Service is required.  Concepts as well as demonstrations of those ideas will be presented and explored.


## What you will learn

In this full day, hands-on workshop you'll learn about the basics of running serverless applications on Red Hat OpenShift. You will also interactively modernize an application to take advantage of Knative. You will get hands-on experience with:
- Serverless introduction and basics
- Modernizing an application with serverless
- How serverless fosters innovation
- Event driven architecture
- Developing cloud native code and updating services
- Observability and metrics in serverless


## Introduction
Welcome to the workshop!

If you are on-site with us, the instructor will walk you through and kick off each lab.  Otherwise, if you're running this on your own, just go through the list of labs in order (as some build off of each other).

These labs have been tailored for OpenShift 4.x
