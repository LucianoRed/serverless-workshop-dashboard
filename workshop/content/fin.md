# That's it!
Hopefully, these labs provided you some idea of how serverless and event driven architectures work. Knative is an emerging technology so keep checking the upstream announcements and blog for exciting news.

Also, release notes are a great place to see changes that occurred between releases. You can find the [OpenShift Serverless release notes here][1] and the upstream [Knative project release notes here][2].

# Get even deeper
This workshop wasn't intended to be full training but rather a "taste of serverless". For a full training experience we recommend you take an official Red Hat course. It'll get much deeper into the concepts and get you ready to leverage a serverless architecture in a production environment.

Reach out to your Red Hat account rep for getting access to official training.
