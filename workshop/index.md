# OpenShift Serverless

## Description

The promises of serverless architectures are very alluring.  True elasticity, seemingly limitless scalability, increased agility, and all with a total lower cost.  What does all this really mean though?  How do organizations actually turn these promises into reality?  Does it impact current infrastructures and architecture?  What does "serverless" even mean?  In this workshop, we will not only teach you what serverless is, but also how using a platform like Red Hat OpenShift Serverless turns the idea of serverless into a solution that is secure, safe, and enterprise ready.  And lastly, we will show you how you can get started building today.


## Who should attend

The workshop is ideal for developers, operations professionals, architects, and technical managers who are interested in getting hands on and exploring the benefits of using serverless technology. You should be familiar with containers and Kubernetes. No prior experience with Serverless or Functions as a Service is required.  Concepts as well as demonstrations of those ideas will be presented and explored.
